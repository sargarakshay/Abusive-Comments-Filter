                                              f**k: a strong word, meaning “very”, or an exclamation, or having *********, depending on connotation

Some also argue “*********” is bad but based on etymology it’s slightly less extreme than s**t and even I use it, so I don’t think it’s that bad.


                                                And finally, “*********” is arguably bad since it means sending you to *********, but since the bible, the most read book in the world (ahem, even children sometimes have to read it) uses it, it is most likely fine.


                                                And for three year old’s, every word with a negative connotation might be considered “bad”, maybe “stupid” and even “Donald Trump” ;)

                                              ********* — Let’s start with this gem, a word that’s very much all around useful. As an expression (“*********!”) it tends to express anything negative. As a verb, it can be used in a number of ways:

                                                * “********* over” — screw over, cheat (“*********ed over by the salesman”)

                                                * “********* …!” — expressing discontent (“********* idiots!”)

                                              Lots of derivatives exist too!

                                                * “*********g” — general intensifier (“*********g awesome!”)
                                                * “*********er” — contemptible person (“that *********er is so d...

                                                  * “*********er” — contemptible person (“that *********er is so dumb”)
                                                  * “*********” — as a noun, it means the act of ********* or a person one *********s or a contemptible person. (“had a good ********* with my *********”)
                                                  * “*********tard” — *********g ********* (“you *********tard”)
                                                  * “*********[any other noun]” — creates a generally negative thing (“*********nut; ******************; *********wad”)
                                                  * “*********eth” — fakely archaic form of “*********” (“And then Shakespeare *********eth Ann and they gitteth hitchéd”)
                                                  * “*********er/*********” — used like extreme versions of “*********er/*********g”. Alternatively, one who has ********* with a mother.
                                                  * “don’t give a *********” to not care in the slightest
                                                  * “rat*********g” — my personal favorite. Refers to dirty political tactics.
                                                  * You can use “the *********” after any wh-word at the start of the question to intensify it (“What the *********?!” “Who the *********?!” “How the *********?!” “Where the *********?!” “Why the *********?!”). Not “Which the *********?!” though.

                                                ********* — Really another nice one, “*********” can be used as a generic adjective to make something seem worse (“My ********* boss” “That ********* *********er” “********* idiot”). As a verb, it can mean to royally screw something over (or send to *********). It can also be used as a general expression (“*********!”). Much lighter than *********. Derived terms:

                                                  * “******************” — like “*********”, but stronger
                                                  * “dammit” — like “*********!” as an expression.

                                                ********* — Flexible, much like “*********”. At the most basic, it can be used to mean “*********”, “to *********” or as an expression like “dammit!” or “*********”. List of derived terms:

                                                  * “*********head, *********-for-brains, ” — idiot (“my boss is a *********head”)
                                                  * “the *********” — great stuff (“this is the *********”)
                                                  * “bull*********” — crud, junk, made-up lies, useless stuff (“what a load of bull*********”)
                                                  * “crock of *********” — made-up lies, useless stuff (“total crock of *********”)
                                                  * “full of *********” — obviously lying (“he’s full of *********”)
                                                  * “ape*********” — to go nuts (“she went ape*********”)
                                                  * “********* factory” — babies or other small animals that produce a lot of ********* (“my cat is a ********* factory”)

                                                There’s a lot more, so I redirect you to Wikitionary.


                                                ********* — Oh, this one. “*********” means a detestable or contemptible, usually shrill, usually annoying, usually mean person. Often, “*********” refers to female, and as such, has been called *********ist. As a verb, “*********” means to complain excessively. We also have meanings of “my friend” (“my *********”), “weakling”, “something difficult and/or unpleasant”.


                                                Notable derived terms:

                                                  * “flip a *********” — illegal U-turn
                                                  * “son of a *********” — light version of “*********er”, or a general expression (“Son of a *********!”)
                                                  * “*********slap” — a sharp, hard slap with an open palm across the face. Often considered *********ist, but often used as well.

                                                *********, ********* — a *********.


                                                ********* — “*********” means a ********* or a stupid person. But (haha) it’s often found in the context of “*********hole”, a detestable and unlikable person. It can also mean, however:

                                                  * ********* (“I got me some *********”)
                                                  * something bad (“tastes like *********” “smells like *********”)
                                                  * a reflexive *********oun, usually when an action is purely physical (“get your ********* over here”)
                                                  * as a suffix, it intensifies the word (“nice” is not as nice as “nice*********”)
                                                      + “Bad*********” is the only exception, meaning something awesome, not awful

                                                ********* — I mean, there’s always the literal meaning. It can also mean somewhere insufferable (“my life is *********”). Derived terms:

                                                  * “… as *********” — intensifier (“dumb as *********”)
                                                  * “*********a” — same meaning as very (“*********a dumb”)
                                                  * “********* of a/*********uva lot of” — a lot (“*********uva lotta good it did you)
                                                  * “*********bent on” — completely determined (“she is *********bent on winning”)
                                                  * “********* hath no fury like a woman scorned” — *********ed-off women are worse than Satan.
                                                  * “living *********, ********* on wheels” — an awful place to be
                                                  * “to ********* with it” — expressing a lack of care

                                                It can also be used in questions like “the *********”.


                                                ********* — Usually refers to “pee”. Also, “********* someone off” means to annoy.

                                              There's really no limit to them except the limits of human creativity.

                                              Another one is “crack*********” (I’m not explaining that one). Sometimes it's written as two words. Either way, it is one noun and quite improper for everyday speech.

Yes, but it has a secondary meaning of, well to be very technical, the receptive male partner in an act of gay ********* ...

                                              Religion. Specifically, monotheism.


                                              Monotheism divides Man into two separate en*********ies, “spirit” and “flesh” and then defines everything having to do with the spirit as good and everything having to do with the body as evil.


                                              It then follows that all words indicating virtue and goodness will be those words that reference the mind, or its processes:


                                              soul, spirit, mind, essence, being, thought, prayer…


                                              And all words indicating vice and evil will be those words that reference the body or its processes:

                                                Note that consciousness-referencing words indicating a person of low moral character do not have the “power” of curses:


                                                scoundrel, heel, cad, ne’er do well, liar, fiend, manipulator, coward…


                                                But those words that do reference immoral character and have the power of curses are, body-referencing:


                                                s*********bag, douchebag, *********er, *********er, son of a *********, *********, *********, *********, *********, *********head.


                                                It also seems to be that the more religious a culture is, the more potent/elaborate/creative its lexicon of profanity is. There seems also to be a relationship between the age of the religion and the degreee of its influence on profanity; the younger a religion, the more swear words/phrases.


                                                I think this is because, in reality, there is no *********—and therefore the older religions were honestly (but mistakenly) trying to identify the truth of existence, whereas newer religions were trying to hide the truth.


                                                Paganism seems to reverse the spirit/virtue body/vice split.


                                                Side topic:


                                                You may have heard that *********anese (the *********anese are mostly atheistic or pagan) has no curses. There is an element of truth in the statement. They do have strong words, but these words don’t reference the body—and directly translating English curses into *********anese usually results in confusion.


                                                examples:


                                                I’ve seen the phrase “Go ********* yourself” have same effect as telling someone to “go kiss your elbow.”


                                                The *********anese word for “*********” is used all the time on kids TV.


                                                On one Sa*********ay morning kids show, a witch held some kids hostage in a cave. One girl reached out and grabbed the witch’s (fake) ********* and twisted it so hard the witch screamed and fell into an abyss.


                                                *********an’s swear words are mostly phrases that, if said, are direct challenges:


                                                Telling someone to “Die!” is like saying “********* you!”


                                                Saying “Don’t challenge me!” is like saying: “I’ll kick my foot right up your *********.”


                                                Also, words indicating lower status, like “eta!” (untouchable low-life) or calling people “you” (“Teme!” ) while using a condescending diction level — can have the same power as racial slurs.


                                                I hope this *********g helps.
